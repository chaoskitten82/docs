Set Up a Local Development Environment with MAMP

Purpose: Outline the process for setting up a local development environment on Mac for the purpose of committing code to a remote repository for deployment to a staging or production environment.

Quick Steps:

Create Site Root
Configure MAMP
Spoof Hosts File
Install NodeJS and Build Tools
1. Create Site Root or Clone a Remote Repository

On your Mac, create a directory in /Users/yourname/Sites/mysite/public_html where mysite is your client... OR clone a remote repository to /Users/yourname/Sites/.

2. Configure MAMP (Local Apache and MySQL Servers)

Download and install MAMP: https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/

Preferences:

Webserver > Apache, Set Document Root (/User/yourname/Sites)
Ports > Apache 80, MySQL 3306
MAMP VirtualHost Conf:

In /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/httpd.conf uncomment the following around line 574:

Modify:

# Virtual hosts
Include /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
In /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf, add a VirtualHost for your site:

Modify:

# NameVirtualHost *:80
NameVirtualHost *
Add:

<VirtualHost *>
    ServerName mysite.dev
    DocumentRoot "/Users/yourname/Sites/mysite/public_html"
</VirtualHost>
3. Spoof Local Hosts File

In /etc/hosts add the following for your site:

Add:

127.0.0.1 mysite.dev
After saving your changes, you are now ready to start MAMP.

Note: Modifying or adding new virtualhost configurations to MAMP will require MAMP Apache to be restarted.

4. Install NodeJS and Build Tools

Download and install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/

Install Gulp/Grunt and whatever other packages you want globally for your development environment.

Note: If you receive errors when pulling down packages with connection to Github, it might be related to a local network firewall preventing use of the git:// protocol. Run the following to update your local git config to the https:// protocol.

git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://
